/- # Today: Numbers and induction

We cover chapter 5 from Mathematics in Lean, and some material about `norm_cast`/`push_cast`
that is not covered in MiL. -/

/-
Last time we discussed sets:
* Set-builder notation: `{ x : X | p x}`;
* Unions/intersections: `⋃ i : ι, C i`, `⋃ i ∈ s, C i` or `⋃₀ C`;
* Images and preimages: `f ⁻¹' s` or `f '' s`;

We also defined the inverse of a function.

/- # Recursion and induction

Let's start by defining our own factorial function.
Note that there is no `:=` -/

def fac : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * fac n

lemma fac_zero : fac 0 = 1 := by sorry

lemma fac_succ (n : ℕ) : fac (n + 1) = (n + 1) * fac n := by sorry

example : fac 4 = 24 := by sorry

theorem fac_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < fac n := by sorry

/-
Two useful tactics:
`norm_num`: compute equalities and inequalities involving numerals
`positivity`: can show that something is positive/non-negative from using that its components are positive/non-negative.

/- We can use `∑ i in range (n + 1), f i` to take the sum `f 0 + f 1 + ⋯ + f n`. -/

example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ i in range 0, f i = 0 :=
  sum_range_zero f

example (f : ℕ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ∑ i in range (n + 1), f i = (∑ i in range n, f i) + f n :=
  sum_range_succ f n

example (n : ℕ) : fac n = ∏ i in range n, (i + 1) := by sorry

/- The following result is denoted using division of natural numbers.
This is defined as division, rounded down.
This makes it harder to prove things about it, so we generally avoid using it
(unless you actually want to round down sometimes). -/

theorem sum_id (n : ℕ) : (∑ i in range (n + 1), i) = n * (n + 1) / 2 := by sorry






/- When using division, it is better to do the calculation in the rationals or reals.
Note that we write `(... : ℚ)` in the left hand side to *coerce* the value to the rationals.
In the infoview (right half of your screen), these coercions are denoted with `↑`.

Some tactics that are useful when working with coercions:
* `norm_cast`: pull coercions out of an expression.
  E.g. turn `↑n * ↑m + ↑k` into `↑(n * m + k)`
* `push_cast`: push coercions into an expression.
  E.g. turn `↑(n * m + k)` into `↑n * ↑m + ↑k`

Note: when coercing from `ℕ` to e.g. `ℚ` these tactics will not push/pull casts along `-` or `/`,
since `↑n - ↑m = ↑(n - m)` and `↑n / ↑m = ↑(n / m)` are not always true.

/- Let's define the Fibonacci sequence -/

def fib : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | (n + 2) => fib (n + 1) + fib n

/- Let's prove an explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence.
Along the way, we will want to write and use some lemmas about `ϕ` and `ψ`
  -/

def ϕ : ℝ := (1 + sqrt 5) / 2
def ψ : ℝ := (1 - sqrt 5) / 2

/- `Nat.two_step_induction` can be used to do an induction with 2 induction hypotheses, i.e.
`P n → P (n + 1) → P (n + 2)`. -/

/- ## A warning on casts
* (in)equalities in different types are not the same statement.
* you can use `norm_cast` to simplify (in)equalities involving casts. -/
